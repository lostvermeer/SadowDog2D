Hi there 👋

Project name: Shadow Dog game 🐕🐶🎮🕹

This is 2D game that I wrote(copied 😅) following tutorial on youtube -> https://youtu.be/GFO_txvwK_c
Using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript 🙈

 I want to make this game fully functional with Frontend and Backend ->

 On going:
- Enemy sound effect

Future direction:
- Initialize authorization/authentication
- Set up database, so that user info will be stored
- Bug fix
- Feature implementation


 If you want to contact me please use my email:
